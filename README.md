Custom Tic Tac Toe Game using 2D Arrays
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built in Java, that uses a 2D array to represent the game board. The game allows for two players to take turns entering their chosen symbol on the board, and the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column or diagonal wins the game.

How to Play
To start the game, simply run the TicTacToe class in a Java IDE. The game will prompt you to enter the names of both players, as well as their chosen symbol to represent them on the board.

The game board will be displayed, and each player will take turns entering their symbol on the board. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column or diagonal will win the game. If all the positions on the board are filled with symbols and no player has won, the game is declared as a tie.
